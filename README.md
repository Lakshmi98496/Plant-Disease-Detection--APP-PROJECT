**üåø AI Plant Disease Detector**

**Overview**

The AI Plant Disease Detector is a full-stack web application designed to help farmers and enthusiasts quickly diagnose common plant diseases from a single image. It utilizes a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model running on a Flask API backend for inference and uses Firebase Firestore for persistent storage of user history and predictions.

This project implements a three-tier architecture ensuring high modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

**‚ú® Features**

**High-Accuracy Diagnosis:** A pre-trained Keras/TensorFlow CNN model classifies 38 different plant diseases and conditions across 14 plant species.

**Confidence Gauge & Severity Score:** Provides a visual confidence score for the prediction and calculates a clear Severity Score (Low, Moderate, High) to guide the user's action.

**Real-time History:** Uses Firebase Firestore to save a permanent log of every successful prediction, accessible in real-time.

**Static Treatment Advice:** Provides immediate, text-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on the predicted class.

**Responsive UI:** Built with HTML/CSS (Tailwind) for a modern, mobile-friendly user experience.

**‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**

The application follows a Three-Layer Architecture:

**Presentation Layer (Client):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (handles image upload, history display, calls to Flask API).

**Business Logic Layer (Server):** Flask application which receives the image, manages the model, and calculates the severity.

**Data Access Layer (Persistence):** Firebase Firestore handles secure user authentication and real-time history storage.

üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

A trained Keras Model file (named plant_disease_model.keras or similar, placed in the root directory).

A Firebase Project configured with Firestore enabled. (The application uses custom authentication tokens provided by the deployment environment, but a Firebase configuration is necessary for the client-side JS).

Installation

Install the required Python packages:

pip install Flask tensorflow numpy pillow


Note: If you encounter issues with TensorFlow, ensure you have the correct version for your environment.

Running the Application

Ensure your plant_disease_model.keras file is in the root directory.

Run the Flask application:

python app.py


The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

**ü§ù Contribution**

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to check the Future Scope section for planned enhancements.

**üîÆ Future Scope**

Dynamic Generative Advice: Replace static advice with real-time treatment recommendations generated by an LLM (e.g., Gemini API), grounded in web search.

Expanded Classification: Include common pests and insect damage in addition to diseases.

Advanced Image Storage: Integrate Firebase Storage for saving the original images alongside prediction metadata.
